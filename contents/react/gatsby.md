## Introduction to Gatsby

Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating websites. Here is the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)


Gatsby helps professional developers efficiently create maintainable, highly-performant, content-rich websites.

* **Load Data From Anywhere**. Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

* **Go Beyond Static Websites**. Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

* **Choose your Rendering Options**. You can choose alternative rendering options, namely Deferred Static Generation (DSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), in addition to Static Site Generation (SSG) — on a per-page basis. This type of granular control allows you to optimize for performance and productivity without sacrificing one for the other.

* **Performance Is Baked In**. Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources, and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

**Use a Modern Stack for Every Site**. No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of whether the data is coming from the same backend.


Use Gatsby's Centralized Data Layer Everywhere. With Gatsby's Valhalla Content Hub you can bring Gatsby's data layer to any project. Making it accessible via a unified GraphQL API for building content sites, eCommerce platforms, and both native and web applications.


Gatsby has 55.6k stars on GitHub.
