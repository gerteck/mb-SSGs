## Static Site Generators

***Quick Tip***: 

If you're new to Static Site Generators, start by identifying your project's requirements (e.g., blogs, documentation, or portfolios) and choose an SSG that matches your preferred programming language. For a lightweight start, try Jekyll or Hugo. For more dynamic functionality, explore Gatsby or Next.js. But of course, you can start by playing around with [MarkBind](https://markbind.org/)!

## What are Static Site Generators?

_Static Site Generators_ are, in short (SSGs), an application that takes plain text files and compiles them to html files, or static web pages. 

Unlike traditional web applications that depend on a backend to dynamically generate content for each request, SSGs pre-build all pages during the site generation process. This results in static web pages that can be served directly by a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or web server. They don't need a backend after site generation.

Some popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, Gatsby and Next.js. There are hundreds of SSGs that exist
